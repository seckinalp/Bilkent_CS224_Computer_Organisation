# Bilkent_CS224_Computer_Organisation
My solutions to Bilkent University Computer Organisation Course (CS224) which focuses on Mips Assembly and System Verilog languages.

## Topics:

`CS 224 - Lab1`: Focuses on array processing, using multiplication and division instructions, and debugging MIPS programs.

`CS 224 - Lab2`: Focuses on understanding of subprogram creation, stack usage, argument passing, result handling, bit manipulation, and dynamic storage allocation with arrays in MIPS assembly language.

`CS 224 - Lab3`: Focuses on constructing dynamic data structures, implementing recursion, and applying the concept of program-as-data in MIPS assembly language.

`CS 224 - Lab4`: Focuses on adding new instructions, adjusting both the datapath and control unit, and demonstrating these changes on FPGA hardware.

`CS 224 - Lab5`: Focuses on constructing and testing a pipelined MIPS processor using SystemVerilog, FPGA, and digital design tools, incorporating pipeline registers, forwarding, hazard detection, and pipeline control logic.

`CS 224 - Lab6`: Focuses on cache efficiency, using experiments to understand cache hit rates under various configurations and programming techniques in MIPS assembly.

`CS 224 - Lab7`: Focuses on developing C programming skills for the PIC32 microcontroller.
